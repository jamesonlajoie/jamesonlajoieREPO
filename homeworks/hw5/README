Throughout this project I used an approach of sorting the digraphs into a vector and then creating 
a map using the vector to fill in each word containing the digraphs.

I defined the wordmap_comparitor in order to sort the vectors by count.
The sort functions sorts the vector by ascii order therefore it was needed to add an iterator to
sort by size of the necessary vector.

I got stuck on a few issues one of which was reversing the ascii order .
The directions say not to use a namespace which caused some conflicty for me.
What I should've done was created another method to reverse the order of the vector after sorting.
