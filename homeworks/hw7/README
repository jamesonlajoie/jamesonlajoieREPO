This is my README file for homework 7

I defined the functions in the order they wqere implemented in the DataLoop.h file.

For the first default constructor i used the list format to initialize the start to nullptr and the count to 0

The rule of 3 states that if a type ever needs to have a user-defined copy constructor, copy assignment operator, or destructor, then it must have all three. Therefore after including the copy constructor I also instituted the copy assignment operator and 
destructor.
